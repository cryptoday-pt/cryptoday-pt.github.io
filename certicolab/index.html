<h2>CertiCoLab</h2>
<p>
    CertiCoLab is an EEA Grants Portugal funded project led by Alex Davidson at NOVA.ID.FCT, and Carlos Cid at Simula UiB. The collaboration has involved several research visits between the two institutions during 2024, with the aim of studying in the field of producing new certifiable secure computation primitives.
</p>
<p>
    The collaboration has led to early stage research in the areas of advancing practical applications based on the learning parity with noise (LPN) problem. On top of this, we intend to continue to look towards making new developments in private set operations protocol, and in the area of building zero-knowledge authentication procedures based on real-world credentials.
</p>
<p>
    The CertiCoLab project terminates at the end of 2024, with the hosting of the Portugal Crypto Day event, to help showcase cryptography investigation performed by Portuguese and Portugal-based researchers.
