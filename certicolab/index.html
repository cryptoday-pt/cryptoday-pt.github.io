<h2>CertiCoLab</h2>
<p>
    CertiCoLab is an EEA Grants Portugal-funded project led by Alex Davidson at NOVA.ID.FCT, and Carlos Cid at Simula UiB. The collaboration has involved several research visits between the two institutions during 2024, and aims to investigate novel certifiable secure computation primitives.
</p>
<p>
    The collaboration has led to early stage research on practical applications based on the Learning Parity with Noise (LPN) problem. The project also intends to continue to work towards making new developments in private set operations protocol, and in the area of building zero-knowledge authentication procedures based on real-world credentials.
</p>
<p>
    The CertiCoLab project concludes in December 2024, with the hosting of Portugal Crypto Day. The event aims to promote and showcase the range of research in cryptography performed by Portuguese and Portugal-based researchers.
