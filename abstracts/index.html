<h3>Title: Quantum Communications in Portugal</h3>
<p>Speaker: Catarina Bastos (<a href="#">Slides</a>)</p>
<p>Bio: Head of Secure Communications and Quantum Technologies Division; Catarina Bastos, PhD in Physics, has become an expert in models using quantum physics to explain different physical aspects of the universe. In 2017 she started in Deimos Engenharia, working in several ESA projects. Recently, she became the Head of Secure Communications and Quantum Technologies Division, leading the Quantum Communications team, coordinating two European projects DISCRETION, a quantum enabled SDN for European Defence and PTQCI, the 1st segment of EuroQCI in Portugal.</p>
<p>Abstract: In this talk I will present the status on quantum communications in Portugal. From the Laboratory to the operational network what has been done through the main actors in industry, academia and public institutions in Portugal. Starting with the development of national technology under a European Defence project, DISCRETION, to the deployment of the first EuroQCI (the European Quantum Communication Infrastructure) segment in Portugal, PTQCI. I will show that quantum communications is no longer a science project, but it is on the heart of sovereignty in Europe.</p>

<h3>Title: Efficient Fully Homomorphic Encryption with Polynomial Noise Overhead</h3>
<p>Speaker: Antonio Guimarães (<a href="#">Slides</a>)</p>
<p>Bio: Antonio Guimarães is a postdoctoral researcher at IMDEA Software Institute in Madrid, Spain. His research interests include all practical aspects of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), with particular focus on verifiable FHE, fast bootstrapping algorithms, and efficient homomorphic evaluation of cryptographic primitives.</p>
<p>Abstract: Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a powerful cryptographic primitive that enables computation directly on encrypted data. The most efficient FHE schemes to date exploit "single-instruction multiple-data" (SIMD) techniques to improve performance, i.e., they perform operations on multiple messages simultaneously to lower their amortized cost. However, these schemes require parameters to be superpolynomially large in the security level, which limits their security and practicality. Specifically, they rely on the hardness of approximate lattice problems with superpolynomial approximation factors, which is a significantly stronger assumption than what is required, for example, for lattice-based public-key encryption. Lightweight FHE schemes, such as TFHE, avoid these problems, but they lack (or have very limited) SIMD capabilities, hindering performance in large-scale applications. In 2018, Micciancio and Sorrell (ICALP'18) introduced the concept of "amortized bootstrapping" as a method to construct FHE with SIMD capabilities and polynomially large parameters. Many follow-ups ensued since then, but their approach remained purely theoretical until recently.</p>
<p>In this talk, we will first provide a high-level overview of existing approaches for constructing FHE schemes with polynomially bounded parameters. We will then discuss "amortized bootstrapping" techniques, which enable SIMD capabilities for these schemes. We will focus particularly on the constructions from GPV23 (Asiacrypt 2023), where we first established the feasibility of this approach, and from GP25 (CCS 2025), where we first demonstrated its concrete practicality. Notably, our latest solution achieves performance improvements of up to 39 times over state-of-the-art libraries such as TFHE-rs.</p>

<h3>Title: From Bell nonlocality to verifiable quantum cryptography and computation </h3>
<p>Speaker: Mafalda Almeida (<a href="#">Slides</a>)</p>
<p>Bio: Mafalda L. Almeida is Principal Manager of R&D in the Quantum Cryptography Team at Quantinuum. Her current research focuses on developing quantum cryptographic protocols that demonstrate quantum advantage while remaining practical for near-term implementation, with a particular emphasis on (semi-)device-independent approaches. More broadly, her interests span the security of quantum communication and computation, exploring both theoretical foundations and applied perspectives.</p>
<p>Abstract: Processing information encoded in quantum systems opens a new world of opportunities and challenges. What began as a theoretical curiosity has evolved into a mature research field, attracting significant attention not only in academia but also in industry. Major tech companies such as Google, IBM, and AWS, among others, have established dedicated quantum divisions, signalling the growing importance of quantum technologies.</p>
<p>In this talk, I will introduce Quantinuum, a full-stack quantum computing company that also houses a quantum cryptography research team. Our interests range from more standard protocols—such as quantum randomness generation and certification—to more unconventional ones, including quantum position verification.</p>
<p>I will highlight the advantages of the device-independent framework for practical cryptographic applications, particularly in providing security against both device imperfections and malicious adversaries. </p>
<p>
  Finally, I will discuss the challenge of verifying that a remote quantum computer is genuinely performing quantum operations. A recent breakthrough in this area involves compiled nonlocal games, which transform Bell games—which can be seen as multi-prover interactive protocols with no communication between the provers—into single-prover interactive protocols based on quantum homomorphic encryption schemes. This development enables powerful results in nonlocality, such as proofs of quantumness and self-testing, to be applied in the verification of quantum computations.

<h3>Title: How Modern Cryptography Breaks in Practice</h3>
<p>Speaker: Filipe Casal (<a href="#">Slides</a>)</p>
<p>Bio: Filipe Casal is a principal security engineer at Trail of Bits. He specializes in security reviews of advanced cryptography, including threshold signature schemes, multi-party computation protocols, fully homomorphic encryption schemes for organizations such as Zama and large-scale zero-knowledge systems for teams such as Scroll and Aleo. Besides manual code review, he employs formal method tools, such as TLA+ and ProVerif, to verify algorithms and custom protocols. In support of these engagements, he also builds custom tooling for implementers and auditors, including ZKDocs, an interactive guide to zero-knowledge proof systems and related primitives; Amarna, a static analyzer and linter for the Cairo programming language; and weAudit, a collaborative code review extension for VSCode.</p>
<p>Before joining Trail of Bits, he served as an invited assistant professor at the University of Lisbon, where he taught and researched type theory, satisfiability procedures, and probabilistic logics for security applications.</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern cryptographic systems often fail in predictable ways. From the familiar flawed Fiat–Shamir transformations to the more obscure threshold key-destruction attacks, we will survey some of the most common catastrophic bugs we repeatedly encounter in security reviews of modern cryptography. While these failures are frequently blamed on implementation mistakes, they are usually caused by an underspecified protocol or a hand-waved paragraph in the primary literature. For each class, we will compare the real-world failure to its violated assumption and draw lessons for robust protocol design and specification practices.</p>

<h3>Title: Digital signature schemes from isogeny-based cryptography</h3>
<p>Speaker: Maria Corte-Real Santos (<a href="#">Slides</a>)</p>
<p>Bio: "Maria is a postdoctoral researcher at CNRS and ENS de Lyon, in the Unité de Mathématiques pures et appliquées (UMPA), working with Benjamin Wesolowski. Her main research interests are post-quantum cryptography, specifically isogeny-based cryptography, and computational number theory. Previously, she completed her PhD at University College London under the supervision of Philipp Jovanovic and Sarah Meiklejohn. Maria is a contributor of the SQIsign submission to NIST's call for alternative post-quantum secure signature schemes, which has progressed to Round 2. She is also co-organiser of The Isogeny Club, an online seminar series for young researchers in isogeny-based cryptography. Maria is passionate about promoting diversity, inclusion, and gender equality within the cryptography community, co-organising Crossfyre 2023, and the Decrypting Diversity Summit 2025."</p>
<p>Abstract: Most public-key cryptography that is deployed in today’s systems is susceptible to attacks by quantum computers. With increasing investment in the development of large-scale quantum computers, it is important to develop cryptography that is secure against both classical and quantum attacks. Considering this, in 2016, NIST began an effort to standardise post-quantum secure key exchange mechanisms and signature schemes. In this talk, we will focus on signature schemes built from a particular type of post-quantum cryptography: isogeny-based cryptography.</p>
<p>After a gentle introduction on isogenies, we will present two signature schemes: SQIsign and PRISM. SQIsign is the only isogeny-based signature scheme that was submitted to NIST's recent alternate call for signatures. On the other hand, PRISM is a much newer and simpler construction, built using the hash-and-sign paradigm.</p>
<p>Though these signature schemes are not as efficient as, for example, lattice-based constructions, they boast the smallest combined signature and public key sizes. Throughout the talk, we will compare the two, discussing their potential advantages and drawbacks.</p>
