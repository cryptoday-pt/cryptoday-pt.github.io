<h3>MAYO, practical post-quantum signatures and a bit more</h3>
<p>Speaker: Sofía Celi</p>
<p>Abstract: MAYO is a post-quantum signature scheme currently under submission to the NIST's new call for post-quantum signatures. Known for its practicality and seamless integration with network protocols, MAYO offers a robust solution to quantum-safety. In this talk, we will delve into the design principles behind MAYO and its practical benefits. Additionally, we will explore how its design can be extended to support advanced primitives such as blind signatures and threshold signatures.</p>

<h3>Formal Verification of Post-Quantum Cryptography in Formosa-Crypto</h3>
<p>Speaker: Manuel Barbosa</p>
<p>Abstract: In this talk I will give an overview of how the Jasmin and 
  EasyCrypt tools are used to formally verify the security of PQC
  designs and the correctness and security of PQC high-speed implementations.
  As examples I will use our recent experience with ML-KEM (formerly Kyber), 
  ML-DSA (formerly Dilithium) and SLH-DSA (formerly SPHINCS+), which were
  recently standardized by NIST.</p>

<h3>Private outsourcing of zkSNARK proof construction</h3>
<p>Speaker: Mariana Gama</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing systems for generating zkSNARK proofs are quite costly, requiring the prover to have access to a powerful machine. Computing such proofs in low-end devices can be prohibitively expensive, motivating the outsourcing of the proving procedure. However, simply handing the computation over to an untrusted cloud server compromises the privacy of the witness. Incidentally, the traditional bottlenecks of most commonly deployed zkSNARKs consist of mostly linear operations on the witness-dependent data and are thus amenable to be computed with multi-party computation (MPC) or fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). In recent years, a few constructions have been presented for efficiently outsourcing proof computation with either MPC or FHE. In this talk, we will overview those existing constructions and introduce some new results in this line of work.</p>

<h3>Pseudo-Entanglement is Necessary for EFI Pairs</h3>
<p>Speaker: Manuel Goulão</p>
<p>Abstract: Regarding minimal assumptions, most of classical cryptography is known to depend on the existence of One-Way Functions (OWFs). However, recent evidence has shown that this is not the case when considering quantum resources. Besides the well known unconditional security of Quantum Key Distribution, it is now known that computational cryptography may be built on weaker primitives than OWFs, e.g., pseudo-random states [JLS18], one-way state generators [MY23], or EFI pairs of states [BCQ23]. We consider a new quantum resource, pseudo-entanglement, and show that the existence of EFI pairs, one of the current main candidates for the weakest computational assumption for cryptography (necessary for commitments, oblivious transfer, secure multi-party computation, computational zero-knowledge proofs), implies the existence of pseudo-entanglement, as defined by [ABF+24, ABV23] under some reasonable adaptations. We prove this by constructing a new family of pseudo-entangled quantum states given only EFI pairs. Our result has important implications for the field of computational cryptography. It shows that if pseudo-entanglement does not exist, then most of cryptography cannot exist either. Moreover, it establishes pseudo-entanglement as a new minimal assumption for most of computational cryptography, which may pave the way for the unification of other assumptions into a single primitive. Finally, pseudo-entanglement connects physical phenomena and efficient computation, thus, our result strengthens the connection between cryptography and the physical world.</p>

<h3>“Noisy” versus “Bounded” Leakage</h3>
<p>Speaker: João Ribeiro</p>
<p>Abstract: Physical implementations of cryptographic schemes are the target of “side-channel attacks”, which aim to extract some information about secret components (e.g., a secret key) by exploiting hardware quirks. This has given rise to the study of leakage-resilient cryptography, whose goal is to design cryptographic schemes that remain secure even when partial information about secret components is leaked to the adversary. There is, however, a mismatch between the theory and practice of leakage-resilient cryptography. Theoretical work on leakage-resilience usually focuses on the bounded leakage model, where the adversary is allowed to learn an arbitrary t-bit output function of the secret key, with t being a predefined threshold. On the other hand, real world side-channel attacks output very long transcripts that contain noisy information about the key. Ideally, we would like to say that every cryptographic scheme that is resilient to bounded leakage is also resilient to “noisy” leakage, for a useful definition of “noisy”. In this talk, I will discuss recent work in this direction.</p>
  
<p>This is based on joint work with Gianluca Brian, Antonio Faonio, Maciej Obremski, Lawrence Roy, Mark Simkin, Maciej Skórski, François-Xavier Standaert, and Daniele Venturi at Eurocrypt 2021 and CRYPTO 2024.</p>
