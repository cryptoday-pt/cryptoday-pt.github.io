<h3>Title: TBD</h3>
<p>Speaker: Mafalda Almeida (<a href="#">Slides</a>)</p>
<p>Bio: Mafalda L. Almeida is Principal Manager of R&D in the Quantum Cryptography Team at Quantinuum. Her current research focuses on developing quantum cryptographic protocols that demonstrate quantum advantage while remaining practical for near-term implementation, with a particular emphasis on (semi-)device-independent approaches. More broadly, her interests span the security of quantum communication and computation, exploring both theoretical foundations and applied perspectives.</p>

<h3>Title: TBD</h3>
<p>Speaker: Maria Corte-Real Santos (<a href="#">Slides</a>)</p>
<p>Bio: "Maria Corte-real Santos is currently a post-doctoral researcher at ENS de Lyon, in the Unité de Mathématiques pures et appliquées (UMPA), working with Benjamin Wesolowski. Her main research interests are post-quantum cryptography, specifically isogeny-based cryptography, and computational number theory. Previously, she completed her PhD at University College London, as part of the CDT for Cybersecurity and the Information Security group, under the supervision of Philipp Jovanovic and Sarah Meiklejohn. Before starting the PhD, she completed Undergraduate and Master’s degree in Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, specialising in Algebraic Number Theory and Elliptic Curves. She organises The Isogeny Club, together with Jonathan Komada Eriksen. She is passionate about communicating cryptography and mathematics to others, and have written a series of blog posts on isogeny-based cryptography, as well as giving a number of outreach talks to STEM students."</p>

<h3>Title: TBD</h3>
<p>Speaker: Paulo Mateus (<a href="#">Slides</a>)</p>
<p>Bio: Paulo Mateus obtained his doctorate in Mathematics from  Instituto Superior Técnico  and was a Postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania. He was awarded the IBM scientific prize, Portugal, in 2005 for his habilitation thesis. Currently he is a Professor from the Mathematics Department of Instituto Superior Técnico and a researcher at Instituto de Telecomunicações. In 2006, he founded and presently coordinates the Security and Quantum Information Group. His research is focused on using quantum resources for security and communication and has been author and co-author of more than 50 peer-reviewed international journal publications in mathematics. He has coordinated several national and international projects and has been guest editor of Logic Journal of the IGPL, IEEE Communications, and part of the program committee of several workshops and conferences. He was invited by the Hungarian (OTKA), Czech (GACR) science foundations, as well as by the Israeli Ministry of Science and Technology, to be a member of the evaluation board for their national projects and postdocs. He was a member of the Managing Board of the European Network and Information Security Agency, vice-president of Centro Internacional de Matemática, and a consultant for the Portuguese National Security Agency.</p>
